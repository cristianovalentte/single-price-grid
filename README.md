# Frontend Mentor - Single price grid component

## The challenge

O desafio consiste em:

- Ver o layout ideal para o componente, dependendo do tamanho da tela do dispositivo;
- Ver um estado de foco na Ã¡rea de trabalho para a frase de chamariz Sign Up.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

- Through this challenge, it was possible to improve the visualization of the project (eg: imagine what to do, before d oing it).
- It was possible to train basic HTML (eg title hierarchy, div, class and id).
- In the CSS it was possible to train more measures, justify-content, among other basic tags, but that leave your site with a different appearance.
